### Odin Members Only

This app is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The main goal of making this app is to practice using passport and passport-local to authenticate user as well as using express-validator to validate form at back-end side.

### Member and Admin code

Since this app is inspired by the Hellfire Club in the series [Stranger Things](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/), the code are:
 + Member: hellfireclub
 + Admin: eddiemunson
